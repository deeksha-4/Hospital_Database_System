# Hospital Database Management System

In this project, I used Python and MySQL to create a common hospital portal for doctors, patients and management staff. 

I used a binary file to store the login details of the patients, doctors and staff. Upon opening the portal, the user can either create a new account or login to their existing one.

Using the portal, patients can make appointments with the doctor of their choice and view their pending fees, doctors can manage their patients and appointments and management staff can add new doctors, view patients' pending fees and view doctors' pending salaries.

In the database, I maintained three tables, patients, doctors and appointments to facilitate the portal's utilities.
